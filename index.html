          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leibniz methodology is an example of the commonly accepted modern technique.  It involves the usage of a particularly beautiful
          taylor series infinite polynomial.  It can be shown using calculus that the exact value of pi is representable by an infinite series of the following form:
          <br/><span><image src="leibniz_general_form.svg"></image></span><br/> which can be expanded to:
          <br/><span><image src="taylor_series_expansion.gif"></image></span><br/>
          This particular taylor series converges much more slowely than others of its variety, but it is a classical example and a fairly fascinating one at that.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monte-Carlo methodology is perhaps the least useful technique here discussed.  It is used commonly enough, though, to demonstrate the
          applicability of computers to mathematical analysis.  It involves the theoretical situation of a dart board having exactly square dimensions in which a circle is
          inscribed such that the edges of the circle are tangent to the edges of the box at exactly four points and do not cross otherwise.  Onto the board a colossal
          number of darts are dropped at random coordinates, the probability that a dart will fall into the circular portion of the board can then be calculated and compared
          to the actual area of the square to give an approximation of the area of the circle which can then be used to approximate pi.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimedian methodology, like the Monte-Carlo methodology, is not particularly useful and relies upon geometrical intricacies to
          make it's point.  However, it is somewhat more elegant than the Monte-Carlo methodology which, while fascinating, amounts to little more than a brute force
          attack on the problem.  The Archimedian method involves sandwiching a circle in the bounds of two polygons with calculable areas and therefore concluding that
          the circle's area must be less than the outer but greater than the inner.  Archimedes himself calculated that pi must sit between the fractions
          <br/><span><image src="pi_upper.gif"></image></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><image src="pi_lower.gif"></image></span>, an approximation which remains
          popular to this day.
